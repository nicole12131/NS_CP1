# NS 1st 🔨 Pseudocode Tic Tac Toe Program

Start the program

Tell the user “Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!”

Create a 3 by 3 board with empty spaces for the moves
Set the first turn to be the user’s turn

While the game is still going:
    Show the board to the user

If it’s the user’s turn:
        Ask the user to pick a row and column between 1 and 3
        If that spot is empty:
            Put an X there for the user
        Otherwise:
            Tell the user that spot is already taken and let them try again

If it’s the computer’s turn:
        Tell the user the computer is making a move
        The computer picks a random empty spot on the board
        Put an O in that spot for the computer

After each move, check if someone won:
        If three of the same symbols are in a row, column, or diagonal:
            Show the board
            Say who won (User or Computer)
            End the game
If the board is full and nobody won:
    Show the board
    Say “It’s a tie!”
    End the game
Switch turns:
        If it was the user’s turn, make it the computer’s turn
        If it was the computer’s turn, make it the user’s turn

When the game is over, say “Game over! Thanks for playing!”

End the program
